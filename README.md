# AI-Powered Portfolio Assistant

Welcome to my next-generation portfolio featuring an advanced AI assistant that combines OpenAI's GPT models with vector search capabilities. Unlike traditional static portfolios, this project demonstrates the power of AI-driven interactions while showcasing my professional experience and technical skills.

## ðŸ¤– AI Features Showcase

### Intelligent Assistant
- **Natural Conversations**: Engage in meaningful discussions about my background, skills, and projects
- **Context-Aware Responses**: The AI maintains conversation context for more natural interactions
- **Smart Resume Handling**: Automatically processes resume requests with secure download links
- **Vector-Based Knowledge**: Uses Pinecone for accurate information retrieval and responses

### How It Works
```
User Query â†’ Context Analysis â†’ Vector Search â†’ GPT Processing â†’ Smart Response
```

- **Query Processing**: Advanced natural language understanding
- **Vector Search**: Semantic matching using Pinecone database
- **Context Management**: Real-time knowledge base updates
- **Security**: Protected routes and secure file handling

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/portfolio-with-chatbot.git
cd portfolio-with-chatbot
```

2. Install dependencies for both frontend and backend:
```bash
# Frontend
cd portfolio-frontend
npm install

# Backend
cd ../portfolio-ai-api
npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:
- Create `.env` files in both frontend and backend directories
- Configure the following variables:

Frontend (.env):
```
VITE_API_KEY=your_api_key
VITE_API_URL=your_backend_url
VITE_ONBOARDING_API=your_onboarding_api_url
VITE_ONBOARDING_API_KEY=your_onboarding_api_key
```

Backend (.env):
```
PORT=3000
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
PINECONE_API_KEY=your_pinecone_key
PINECONE_INDEX_NAME=your_pinecone_index
PINECONE_INDEX_HOST=your_pinecone_host
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_uri
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=1d
AWS_REGION=your_aws_region
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_aws_key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_aws_secret
S3_BUCKET_NAME=your_s3_bucket_name
EMAIL_USER=your_email
EMAIL_RECIPIENT=your_recipient_email
EMAIL_APP_PASSWORD=your_email_app_password
